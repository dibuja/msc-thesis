# MSc Thesis — Analysing Political Polarisation using Natural Language Processing

Through this project, we aim at analysing the level of polarisation present in the Spanish Parliament – Congreso de los Diputados – throughout the XXI century. We are trying to address the following research questions:

```
RQ1: Are politics in the parliament more polarized now — both ideologically and emotionally? How did it evolve for the last ~20 years?
RQ2: What topics present a higher level of polarisation?
RQ3: How has each political party evolved in terms of sentiment & ideological placement throughout time?
```

For that purpose, we are:

- [x] Gathering all the relevant data from https://congreso.es using scrapers and PDF parsers;  
- [ ] Make the dataset publicly available;    
- [x] Pre-processing it to remove any irrelevant elements;  
- [ ] Exploring different algorithms within NLP to represent the ideological placement of the main political parties present in the parliament, such as Word Embeddings, Paragraph Embeddings and Transformers;  
- [ ] Test and optimise the usage of these models;  
- [ ] Analyse and visualize the ideological displacement and the sentiment of Spanish political parties throughout the XXI century.
